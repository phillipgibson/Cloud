# Using Azure Front Door Service (AFD) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  
Recently we [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-front-door-service-is-now-generally-available/) the general availabilty of the Azure Front Door Service (AFD). If you're not familiar with the Azure Front Door service and what it is, you can simply think of it as a global endpoint service for your web applications. For me What's really exciting about AFD if you are using AKS, is the ability to take advantage of some key functionality AFD possesses like global https load balancing, WAF capablities, and URL rewite just to name a few. Having all of that functionality with ADF really helps streamline the architecture and makes it really easy to deploy and host global applications with AKS. Let's begin!
